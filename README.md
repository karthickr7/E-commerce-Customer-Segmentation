# E-commerce-Customer-Segmentation
# Abstract:
  A key challenge for E-commerce businesses is to analyze the trend in the
market to increase their sales. The trend can be easily observed if the
companies can group the customers based on their activity on the E-commerce
website. This grouping can be done by applying different criteria like
previous orders, mostly searched brands and so on.
# Problem Statement:
  Given the E-commerce data, use K-means clustering algorithm to cluster
customers with similar interest.
# Dataset Information:
  The data was collected from a well known E-commerce website over a
period of time based on the customer’s search profile.
# Scope:
  ● Analyzing the existing customer data and getting valuable insights
about the purchase pattern
  ● Data pre-processing including missing value treatment
  ● Segmenting customer based on the optimum number of clusters (‘k’)
with the help of silhouette score.
# Learning Outcome:
  We will get a better understanding of how the variables are
linked to each other and will be able to apply cluster analysis to business
problem such as customer segmentation.
